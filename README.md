# 22_Redux-Store_State

# Purpose:
Refactor an e-commerce platform from the module project so that it uses Redux.

# Description:
In this challenge, we refactor the e-commerce platform from the module project so that it uses Redux. We wonâ€™t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but we will read through the Redux documentation on our own to find the information we need.
We want our platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API so that moury website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

# Built With:
* Redux
* React
* Stripe npm package
* Stripe.js
* Heroku
